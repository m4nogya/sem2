    <p>A graphics driver usually supports one or multiple cards by the same vendor and has to be specifically written for an
    operating system. Additionally, the operating system or an extra software package may provide certain programming APIs
    for applications to perform 3D rendering.</p>

    <p>processor (CPU) is the logic circuitry that responds to and processes the basic instructions that drive a computer. The
    CPU is seen as the main and most crucial integrated circuitry (IC) chip in a computer, as it is responsible for
    interpreting most of computers commands. CPUs will perform most basic arithmetic, logic and I/O operations, as well as
    allocate commands for other chips and components running in a computer.
    
    The term processor is used interchangeably with the term central processing unit (CPU), although strictly speaking, the
    CPU is not the only processor in a computer. The GPU (graphics processing unit) is the most notable example, but the
    hard drive and other devices within a computer also perform some processin</p>
